                    About <i>{durationString()}</i> ago, I met an <span style={{color: "rgb(22, 177, 22)", textDecoration: "underline", cursor: "pointer"}} onClick={() => {

                        incredible woman
                    </span> who changed my life, and my perspective for the better.
                </p>
                <p>This one time, she was travelling to her hometown, and I wanted to make her a playlist to keep her company.</p>
                <p>But a regular Spotify/Youtube playlist couldn't express the magnitude of what I felt. (I was also actively trying to impress her at the time*)</p>
                <p>In my defense, I hadn't listened to <i>I Wanna Be Yours</i> then.</p>
                <p>As Alex Turner so eloquently put it,</p>
                <p style={{textAlign: "center", color: "rgb(172, 134, 12)"}}>
                    <i>"I wanna be your vacuum cleaner</i>

                    <i>Breathing in your dust"</i>
                </p>
                <p>That's where the idea of Mixtape, an app built around the experience of making playlists, was born.</p>
                <p>Hopefully, it can make the same kind of magic for you as it did for us.</p>
